# function-sdk-typescript

A Node.js / TypeScript SDK for writing [composition functions][functions].

This SDK is currently a alpha. It has been created out of curiosity if it's a good idea to 
write composition functions in TypeScript and to asses the options it provides.

If you just want to jump in and get started, consider using the [function-template-typescript] 
template repository.
